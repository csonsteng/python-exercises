# python-exercises
This repository contains small one off exercises and projects that don't warrant
their own repository at this stage.

Blackjack:
This is a blackjack simulator. The game starts by running the deckgenerator.py script
Splitting a hand is broken right now.
It also doesn't know what to do when the shoo runs out of cards.
There is a lot of potential for clean-up in here.

The end goal of this app is to use it as a blackjack trainer and to provide EV to the player
for different hands along with recommended choices.

Budget:
These are a few different financial utility scripts I wrote to help me with forecasting and making financial decisions. The functionalities of these are intended to be reproduced and expounded upon on the finance portion of my personal website.


Smite:
Smite is a 3rd Person MOBA I used to play with friends. This utility scrapes a few different sites using BeautifulSoup to track games played along with ELO (rank), opponents, teammates, and builds. It can be used to find most common opponents, most common teammates, most common characters, etc... It is currently set up to track games from my entire clan and provide my ELO over time (with some questionable scaling choices) by running Controller.py

This is kind of messy and not well commented; however was written while I had a severe concussion.
